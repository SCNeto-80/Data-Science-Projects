# Data-Science-Projects
# Welcome to My Data Science Projects Repository!
This repository contains a portfolio of data science projects that I have completed as part of the Applied Data Science Program | MIT Professional Education and through self-learning. Each project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization, showcasing my ability to apply a wide range of data science techniques and tools.

This repository includes:
- **Data Analysis and Visualisation**
  - *Project:* **FoodHub Data Analysis**  
    In this project, part of my Foundations for Data Science within the Applied Data Science Program | MIT Professional Education, I performed exploratory data analysis on the FoodHub dataset. The aim was to analyze customer orders to understand restaurant demand and enhance customer experience. By employing data visualization and statistical methods, I derived insights into order trends and service performance to inform business decisions..
  
- **Deep Learning**
  - *Project:* **Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition**  
    As part of my elective project in the Applied Data Science Program | MIT Professional Education, I explored both artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to recognize digits in the Street View Housing Numbers dataset. This project focuses on image preprocessing, model architecture design, and the training process for accurate digit classification.

  - *Project:* **Malaria Detection**  
    For my capstone project within the Applied Data Science Program | MIT Professional Education, I created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) aimed at classifying microscopic images of cells as either infected with malaria or uninfected. This project highlights the application of deep learning in medical diagnostics.
  
Note: This repository is still under construction, and I will be adding new projects and improving existing ones over time. Feel free to check back for updates.
